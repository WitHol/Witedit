This is my attempt at making a command-line code editor that I'll propably never finish.
If I do, however, it'll be called "Witedit".

Right now i don't have a propper "releases" tab, you'll need to build it yourself. You need to have gcc along with ncurses installed,
and run the compile script (should work on all os')

Remember though, that this is not even completed yet, and the code is very likely to contain bugs, or not work at all
