This is my attempt at making a command-line code editor that I'll propably never finish. If I do, however, it'll be called "Witedit".

If you want to build the editor yourself, you'll need to have gcc along with ncurses installed, and run the compile script (should work on all os')

Remember though, that this is not even completed yet, and the code (exept for releases) is very likely to contain bugs, or not work at all
